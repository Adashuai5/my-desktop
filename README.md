This is the first project I wrote using React Hooks and Typescript.

It's not as simple as React isn't a tech stack I'm familiar with, Typescript is good but I'm also unskilled, stepping over a lot of potholes in between. Also since my computer is a windows system and I can't find the relevant UI diagram online, it took me a long time to build the prototype. But the process was also very interesting and challenging, especially when it came to implementing the various animations of the macOS desktop.

This project is just getting started, so if you're interested why not star and watch it!
